* What it does

When ran, Nodeinterval watches a directory of files for changes. When it detects
a change it concats all the files in the directory and inserts them into a
specific area of a chosen document. Leave NodeInterval running in a seperate tab
as you work on your project.

The most common example is separating out your template files in a [[http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/][backbone.js]]
or [[http://maccman.github.com/spine/][spine.js]] app so that templates are out of your html page and into organized
folders. Think of it as a simple version of [[http://sass-lang.com/][Sass]] for your JavaScript templates.

* Features

1. Works with all templating solutions including [[http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/][underscore.js]] and [[http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/][jQuery templates]].
2. Hidden files (files that begin with "." like .git, .svn, and .DS_Store) are automatically ignored.
3. Profiles the time it takes to render all templates.
4. Date-stamped, clean, and color-coded command-line output:

: $ node nodeinterval.js
: 18 Aug 01:47:49 - INFO: NodeInterval is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
: 18 Aug 01:47:49 - INFO: overwrite ../assets/index.html
: 18 Aug 01:47:49 - INFO: Completed in 0.001 seconds.
: 18 Aug 01:48:04 - INFO: >>> Change detected to: ~/git/projectName/src/html/templates/signon/signon.tmpl
: 18 Aug 01:48:04 - INFO: overwrite ../assets/index.html
: 18 Aug 01:48:04 - INFO: Completed in 0.002 seconds.

* To install

There are two ways to install.

1. npm method:

:    npm install nodeinterval

For those new to npm, this will create a =node_modules= directory with the
module and it's dependencies. From here you can use one of the sample scripts in
the samples directory. Edit it to adjust to your folder structure, make it
executable, then run it.

2. git method

Clone this repo.

If you don't have a nice appliction folder architecture check the section below
titled "Sample web application layout".

* Usage
: var NodeInterval = require('nodeinterval');
: var nodeInterval = new NodeInterval({
:    watchFolder: '../src/html/templates/',
:    inputFile: '../src/html/index.html',
:    replacementString: '@templates@',
:    outputFile: '../assets/index.html'
:});

Where:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| =watchFolder=       | is the relative or absolute path to the folder you want to monitor.                                                                                          |
| =inputFile=         | is the main template you want to duplicate.                                                                                                                  |
| =replacementString= | is the string inside of =inputFile= that you want to replace with all your templates.                                                                        |
| =outputFile=        | is the relative or absolute path to the file you want to create (that's a copy of =inputFile= with the =replacementString= replaced with all your templates. |

* Sample web application layout:

If you don't have a good web application layout. Here's a good one to follow:

: .
: ├── assets               <== Your compressed assets, ready for production.
: │   ├── images
: │   ├── index.html       <== "Built" html file with your rendered templates.
: │   ├── js
: │   └── css
: ├── bin                  <== Shell scripts. "npm install nodeinterval" here.
: │   ├── node_modules     <== This folder will automatically be created.
: │   │   └── nodeinterval <== nodeinterval and it's dependencies will be
: │   │                        installed here.
: │   ├── nodeinterval.sh  <== This sample file (and the .js) version is inside
: │   │                        of nodeinterval/samples/. Use it if you like.
: │   └── sasswatch.sh     <== I like to create a Sass executable for watching
: │                            my CSS files.
: └── src                  <== Raw uncompressed code here, where you should be
:     │                        editing your codez.
:     ├── index.html       <== Raw index.html files with "replacementString"
:     │                        where you want the templates.
:     ├── css              <== Uncompressed CSS assets.
:     ├── js               <== Uncompressed JS assets.
:     └── templates        <== Your .js templates. These can be all in one
:                              folder or seperated out into many folder deep,
:                              according to section. Incude the <script> part
:                              in your templates.

* Requirements:

You must have [[http://nodejs.org/][Node.js]] installed in your path. [[http://npmjs.org/][NPM]] (Node package Manager) if you
want to install this package using it.

Internally NodeInterval uses the following (included) node packages:
[[https://github.com/DelvarWorld/Simple-Node-Logger][Simple-Node-Logger]], [[https://github.com/jorritd/node-watch][node-watch]], and [[https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore][underscore]].

* Future plans:

1. Add and remove events. Currently NodeInterval only supports listening for
  changes. In the future it will also listen for adding and removing of templates.
2. A polling interval option.
3. JS compression. Include [[https://github.com/mishoo/UglifyJS][UglifyJS]] to optionally auto-compress and concat JS
  files in addition to templates. Note that we don't plan on compressing
  templates as they can contain a combination of HTML/CSS/JS and
  template-library-specific shorthand that a normal compressor wouldn't
  understand.
