* What it does

When ran, NodeInterval watches a directory of templates for changes. When it
detects a change it concats all the templates together and inserts them into a
specific area of a chosen webpage. Leave NodeInterval running in a seperate tab
as you work on your project.

NodeInterval is commonly used in [[http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/][backbone.js]], [[http://maccman.github.com/spine/][spine.js]], and other web app
frameworks where you're using JavaScript templates so that templates are out of
your html page and into organized folders.

Think of it as a simple version of [[http://sass-lang.com/][Sass]] for your JavaScript templates.

NodeInterval can also be used generically to concat any type of file into any
time of document.

* Features

1. Works with all templating solutions including [[http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/][underscore.js]] and [[http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/][jQuery templates]].
2. Hidden files (files that begin with "." like .git, .svn, and .DS_Store) are automatically ignored in template directories.
3. Profiles the time it takes to render all templates.
4. Supports watching multiple sets of input and output files. 
5. Clean, date-stamped, and color-coded command-line output:
: $ node nodeinterval.js
: 18 Aug 01:47:49 - INFO: NodeInterval is watching for changes. Press Ctrl-C to stop.
: 18 Aug 01:47:49 - INFO: overwrite ../assets/index.html

* Requirements
- You must have [[http://nodejs.org/][nodejs]] installed.
- [[http://npmjs.org/][NPM]] (Node package Manager) if you want to install this package using it.
* To install

There are two ways to install. Cloning this repo or using [[http://npmjs.org/][npm]]. If you want to
run the unit tests, you must clone this repo. Once you have the package
installed feel free to modify and use the sample script in the =samples=
directory:

:    cd bin # Your scripts directory.
:    npm install nodeinterval
:    cp node_modules/nodeinterval/samples/nodeinterval.sh .
:    emacs nodeinterval.sh # Setup your variable paths with your favorite editor.
:    chmod u+x nodeinterval.sh
:    ./nodeinterval.sh # Start watching your files

Alternatively, you can use the sample .js file instead of the .sh version and
run it like so:

: node nodeinterval.js

* Usage

: var Nodeinterval = require('nodeinterval'),
: ni = new Nodeinterval.Watcher({
:     inputFile: '../path/to/raw/index.html',
:     outputFile: '../path/to/rendered/index.html',
:     replacementString: '@templates@',
:     watchFolder: '../path/to/templates/'
: }).startWatch();

Options you can pass to =new Nodeinterval.Watcher= are:

| Option              | Description                                                                                                                                                  | default                |
|---------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------------|
| =inputFile=         | is the main template you want to duplicate.                                                                                                                  | '../src/index.html'    |
| =outputFile=        | is the relative or absolute path to the file you want to create (that's a copy of =inputFile= with the =replacementString= replaced with all your templates. | '../assets/index.html' |
| =replacementString= | is the string inside of =inputFile= that you want to replace with all your templates.                                                                        | '@templates@'          |
| =watchFolder=       | is the relative or absolute path to the folder you want to monitor.                                                                                          | '../src/templates/'    |

Once a new =Nodeinterval.Watcher= is created. It has the additional api methods:

| Method      | Description                                                                                                            |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| startWatch  | All files in =watchFolder= are now being watched.                                                                      |
| stopWatch   | All files in =watchFolder= are now not being watched.                                                                  |
| updateIndex | Force =outputFile= to be refreshed with =inputFile=, with =replacementString= replaced with contents of =watchFolder=. |

NodeInterval can also watch multiple input and output files. Just use an array to specify filenames under =inputFile= and =outputFile=. This is good, for example, where you have two sets of html files, one for uncompressed js and css and one for compressed css and js, and you want both files to render your templates on change.

* Sample web application layout

If you don't have a good web application layout. Here's a good one to follow:

: .
: ├── assets               <== Your compressed assets, ready for production.
: │   ├── images
: │   ├── index.html       <== "Built" html file with your rendered templates.
: │   ├── js
: │   └── css
: ├── bin                  <== Shell scripts. "npm install nodeinterval" here.
: │   ├── node_modules     <== This folder will automatically be created.
: │   │   └── nodeinterval <== nodeinterval and it's dependencies will be
: │   │                        installed here.
: │   ├── nodeinterval.sh  <== This sample file (and the .js) version is inside
: │   │                        of nodeinterval/samples/. Use it if you like.
: │   └── sasswatch.sh     <== I like to create a Sass executable for watching
: │                            my CSS files. (not part of this project)
: └── src                  <== Raw uncompressed code here, where you should be
:     │                        editing your codez.
:     ├── index.html       <== Raw index.html files with "replacementString"
:     │                        where you want the templates.
:     ├── css              <== Uncompressed CSS assets.
:     ├── js               <== Uncompressed JS assets.
:     └── templates        <== Your .js templates. These can be all in one
:                              folder or seperated out into many folder deep,
:                              according to section. Incude the <script> part
:                              in your templates.

* Thanks

Internally NodeInterval uses the following (included) node packages:
[[https://github.com/DelvarWorld/Simple-Node-Logger][Simple-Node-Logger]], [[https://github.com/jorritd/node-watch][node-watch]], and [[https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore][underscore]].

* Contribute

Feedback and contributions (via pull requests) are more than welcome. Please add
a test to the unit tests if it's a new feature. NodeInterval is really young and
mostly written in one night. I'll be updating it with features as I use it in my
daily projects.
